**Simulation of process planning in the OS**

In this practical work, the approximate process of planning processes in the OS was considered. 
For this, a multi-level queue algorithm with main and background processes was used. 
The main processes were performed according to the mother algorithm, and the background processes according to the father algorithm.

_The following algorithms were used for the processes:_
- Main processes - RR (Round Robin)
- Background processes - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
